# Kaggle-Pawpularity
This is our machine learning project where we build a predictive machine learning model that will be able to efficiently and accurately grade the pawpularity score which indicates how appealing the photograph of a pet offered for adoption on online platforms is.

## Overview

Nowadays, millions of stray animals are alone on the streets or living in shelters, waiting for a new home. With the aim of better understanding the impact of pet photos and their features, [*PetFinder.my*](https://www.petfinder.my/) - Malaysia's leading animal welfare platform - designed a metric which measures pet photo popularity - *Pawpularity* - and hosted a related [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-pawpularity-score/overview).

Follows the architecture of our best performing solution for the competition:

# Results 
We can only compare with the leaderboard score as the competition is already over. We managed to get between 186th and 187th place, which is top 5.29%
